# Pedestrain tracking 

This software allows you to track multiple objects on a aerial video across multiple sessions\

The software allows a user to define a tracking object, once the video is completed the tracked object path (x,y) is saved on a tracking_data.csv file; in the following session the tracking_data is loaded and visualized\

Trackers comes from OpenCV https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/df8/group__tracking.html \
